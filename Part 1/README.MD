## Plot1 Instructions

Plot1 will create a histogram of the Global active power on Feb 1st and 2nd 2007.
It will download the data into a temp file direct from the URL given in the assignment.
Note that as this script contains no function definitions, it will
run when sourced.Also, I did not use fread or filter the file when reading, so
be wary of memory issues.

As the file runs, print statements will let you know of the current position.
